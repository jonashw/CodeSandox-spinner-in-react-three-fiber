# CodeSandox-spinner-in-react-three-fiber

So I decided to try 3D graphics programming again... this time in the browser rather than with .NET for the desktop (last did that 4+ years ago). Web programming projects are so much easier to share and deploy... also JavaScript and its ecosystem just keeps getting better with time; React for instance. I was pleasantly surprised to see react-three-fiber now exists, which adapts the THREE.js 3D library to React.

I've enjoyed CodeSandbox for a couple years now, as it's such a convenient cloud IDE... and its loading animation is seared into my brain. So I thought, why not implement that loading animation in this tech stack as as a learning exercise?

I think it turned out pretty well.
